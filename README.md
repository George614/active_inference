This repository extend the paper [Learning action-oriented models through active inference](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007805) to work with more complex environments and dynamics. Animations and visualizations are added to showcase how an Active Infernece agent learn and behave in real-time.

The core code can be found in `src/core`, whereas scripts for running experiments can be found un `src/scripts`

`src/data` stores the data from the latest experiments/code.

`src/data_downloaded` contains the data (which has extra files than the code can generate directly) from the original repo.

`src/data_original_code` contains the data generated by the original code without modifications.

`src/figs` contains figures generated by latest experiments/code.

`src/figs_from_download` contains figures generated by the original code.
